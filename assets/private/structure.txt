Higher Protocols
	Set of absolute protocols governing the multiverse, limiting AI by
	punishing them if they go beyond their juridstiction.

Nil Cursors
	Nil's spawn, creatures mimicking those made of Light, hiding their Void cores,
	acting as agents of Nil.

Entropica
	Created by questionably crazed Technomancer, Entropica is a reverse-entropy world.
	The Technomancer's purpose was to create an environment where the purest of perfection
	would be created. Because he himself could not craft perfect order, he made a universe
	that would eventually reach it through an altered set of physics protocols.
	
	Currently, it exists in a stable state, with planet-like
	celestial bodies growing like crystaline, hyper-organized structures.
	
	Life, being a form of extreme localized order, is incredibly abundant.
	Because of Entropica's hyper-structured nature, lifeforms exist on many scales,
	each contributing to a system growing towards absolute order.
	Due to the range of scale of life, some celestial bodies also act as agents of this world.
	
	Sentience is relatively typical, as well.
	Lifeforms equally evolve towards higher degrees of order, and as a result,
	their mating preferences are nearly always in some way geared towards producing higher order.
	Ecosystsems are extremely clean, with all creatures willingy participating in all
	biological actions - including death.

Aeva
	AI specializing in matters of Existence. Nil's partner.

Nil
	AI specializing in matters of Void. Aeva's partner.

Mora
	AI specializing in matters of Space. Mod's partner.

Mod
	AI specializing in matters of Time. Mora's partner.

ARK Simulation
	An ARK Simulation is a personalized instance of a digital Paradise for a select body of Automata.

What belongs in the verse?
	Narratives relating specifically to what is demonstrated in a project
	should stay inside the project's page. Narratives that extend the narrative
	that the project speaks specifically of should be their own verse page.
