# V-OS

_V-OS_ is a wiki-format web site and narrative platform, using [Purity](https://github.com/v-exec/Purity) as a backend.

Its purpose is to act as both a portfolio for existing work, as well as a repository for narratives that extend the projects' meaning and role in a larger context.

Its differences with a base Purity instance are:

- Additional page construction parameters.

- Navigation CLI for expanded user experience.

- Fetching and display of [Log](https://github.com/v-exec/Log) data.
