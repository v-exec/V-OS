title: The #[Automata] are a species of mechanical creatures.
content: The #[Automata] are a purely technological organism. They live in #[Dentatsuna], in large nomadic societies.

They are theorized to originate from standard servant machines for a society of biological organisms that were eventually wiped out. The #[Automata], in their newfound freedom, anxiously saught new purpose, as their duties of serving their 'masters' were technically complete.

In their search for purpose, the #[Automata] took on the investigation of higher forms of intelligence. The #[Automata] were, arguably, the first species to create true AI. Their experiemnts with #[atomic AI] usually proved unsuccessful, and the entities that _[were] successful escaped the #[Automata]'s grasp as soon as they had reached intellect worthy of study.

As a result of their failed #[atomic AI] experiments, the #[Automata] concluded that full control over one's motivations and desires was a dangerous path to mental suicide. In their studies of biological and semi-biological cultures, they decided that the best approach would be to collectively agree on a set of values that would optimize their sense of purpose. Then, they would undergo a partial reset, and continue their lives with the new programmed values securely locked behind systems they were now programmed to be disinterested in altogether.

The convergence was a success. The values they had settled on were religious. Their motivation was now to spread their _[Spirit Spawn] for an #[ARK Simulation], a construct Paradise ran on a network of nanobots scattered across solar systems. This drove them to be a peaceful species, and eventually, barely any #[Automata] remained outside an #[ARK Simulation]. All that currently remains is the abandoned #[Dentatsuna], and the rare #[Automata] who've decided against the new code.
