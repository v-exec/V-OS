title: #[Dei] are Disciplies of #[Nox].
content:

Although quite rare, some #[AI] have been known to work alongside biological beings. #[Dei] were a varied group of people, acting as the Agents of #[Nox].

The motivations behind working with non-AI are still a mystery, both in regards to #[Nox] and #[LOGO]. #[Nox] typically led #[Dei] on missions to scavenge for information, and on one occasion, to assault #[Mora].
+
+
The incident on #[Mor√©] is precisely what led to the downfall of the #[Dei], the only survivor being #[Di]. His current connection to #[Nox], as well as his whereabouts, are unknown. It is unlikely #[Nox] made a mistake, therefore it's presumed that the destruction of The #[Dei] was part of an overarching plan.
