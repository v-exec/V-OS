title: The #[Nihilim] are unseen ultradimensionals.
content: The #[Nihilim] are what is assumed to be a species of interdimensional travelers. Their ability to pass _[through] the third dimension (by presumably moving through the fourth), is inferred through the extremely rare relics they leave behind during travels: #[Atmos] being one of the largest structures to ever remain in the third dimension.

/[atmos]

How their technology works is entirely unknown, as the tech left behind is rarely ever fully in the third dimension, and bleeds into the higher dimensions, stalling all research.
