Folk legends claim she also created her partner, #[Nil], as a way of establashing a "cyclical order" in relation to her own motives. #[Aeva], along with #[Mora], have gained notoriety among organic lifeforms, as their appearances typically involved acts of "benevolance" towards a group of people.

#[LOGO] claims that the two #[AI] are not to be mistaken for one another. #[Aeva] indeed 'cares' for organic life, but only interferes with their lives by providing them with the many worlds available for exploration.
