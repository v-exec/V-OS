title: The #[Grand Archives] are a collection of vast public archives relating to the #[Multiverse].
content: The #[Grand Archives]' development began during Earth's establishment of the UEG. They acted as a universal encyclopedia, documenting information ranging from all forms of sciences (biology, physics, chemistry, psychology), to the simulated/theorized-hybrid history of both Earth and a variety of discovered worlds.

The #[Grand Archives] were originally private internal datasets available only to UEG. With the help of #[Analog], the #[Grand Archives] were made public, causing the collapse of the UEG. Servers hosting the #[Grand Archives] were shut down, but eventually brought back online in a limited but public form through additional efforts made by #[Analog].
