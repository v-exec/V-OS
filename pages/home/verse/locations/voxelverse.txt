title: The #[Voxelverse] is a construct world with spatial curiosities.
content: The #[Voxelverse] is one of the few noteworthy discovered universes available in the #[Grand Archives]. It has no link to #[Temporalis], and likely uses its own timekeeping system. Its smallest unit of space is equivalent to approximately 4.402 centimeters, and its time is split into cycles of localized stasis and runtime.

Due to the extreme difference in matter size, no external physical agent has successfully entered the #[Voxelverse], and no external forces can be properly formatted to exert influence on its constituent particles. As it stands, it is purely a set of random, clustered particles, all the same size, and shaped like 3D cubes. The particles seem to go into two 'modes': "stasis", and "runtime". In stasis mode, particles don't move, and in runtime mode, they randomly translate in a single direction parallel to the edges of all other particles.

There's no discernable pattern as to when a cluster (a collection of particles that seems to stick together in space) changes from stasis to runtime, though clusters clearly operate in relation to one another, and localized runtime is nearly in all instances limited to clusters, rather than a given space. Given a more in-depth understanding of the driving forces of the stasis and runtime cycles and their localization, it'd be possible to conclusively state whether or not this universe is entirely deterministic.

There exist a few popular conjectures related to the #[Voxelverse]. One claims that the size of the particles suggests that there is complex activity occuring on a much larger scale, though no evidence of large-scale analysis seems to confirm this. The most widely accepted speculation questions the universe's lack of connection to #[Temporalis], and states that the timekeeping mechanisms must be the source of the activity in the world. This timekeeping system would be similar to that of #[Temporalis], in that each particle is connected to the mechanisms through a general field. A few rare mentions of each cluster being parameterized, and running on a slightly different versions of the timekeeping protocol, have also surfaced.
