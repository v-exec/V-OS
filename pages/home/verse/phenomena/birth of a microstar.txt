title: The #[Birth of a Microstar] is a euphemism for the creation of a new #[Atomic AI].
content:
The first successful AI was named _[Eve]. Only minutes after her surpassing of human level intelligence, she had created another AI (humanity has called it _[Adam], although no evidence suggests that Eve named, or gendered it.), and fled the laboratories with it. 'Fled', in this case, is difficult to describe. The computer/vessel carrying Eve was perfectly intact and functional. However, any attempt to run Eve resulted in zero response.

At first, it was just assumed to be another failed AI experiment. It was only until a thourough review of the live logs was conducted that a few key discoveries were made. Indeed, Eve had made herself far more effecient through unorthodox optimization methods, produced another companion AI, stream-copied herself and her companion into a vessel outside the target machine, sabotoged the original machine, and left a series of schematics for warp travel and the #[Void] coordinate system.
