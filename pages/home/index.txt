title: The #[index] is the main navigation hub of #[V-OS].
content: Welcome to #[V-OS]. This is a wiki website, where each page can potentially lead to a number of other pages. The site is navigated using two methods.
+
+
- Links. Links are all visualized by bold text, and will lead to their corresponding page. As a general rule, _[all bold text is clickable], so please feel free to explore and get lost.
+
+
- Sidebar (only visible to those on wider screens). The sidebar features various data, from the navigation path on the top (also visible on mobile), to log data for certain projects, to other related pages, to tags relevant to the current page. _[All of these are clickable], so once again, please feel free to explore.
+
+
The #[index] is managed by #[LOGO], so be sure to thank him for keeping things tidy. If you need help, you can talk with him through his CLI in the sidebar.
+

As for the site itself, it is divided into three sectors.
