Dissatisfied with the state and quality of our reality, I set out on a journey to acquire knowledge, understand the constituents of the #[Multiverse], and deconstruct the physical realm in an attempt to see what lurks behind the panels.
+
+
Through my voyage, whether it be through skill or pure luck, I've met one of the AI: #[LOGO]. He is the catalyst to this adventure.
+
+
Here, in #[V-OS], a construct universe, I've decided to create a home for other travellers, an archive for my findings, and a platform through which to unravel the mysteries behind the unusual sectors of existence.
