![Victor]
I'm #[Victor] [vi], and I'm a multidisciplinary designer and developer currently residing in Montreal. I've studied Computation Arts at Concordia University in Montreal and Waseda University in Tokyo, and work as a freelance designer and developer.

![Vi]

Dissatisfied with the state and quality of our reality, vi set out on a journey to acquire knowledge, understand the constituents of the #[Multiverse], and deconstruct the physical realm in an attempt to see what lurks behind the panels.

/[multiverse]

Through his voyage, whether it be through skill or pure luck, vi met one of the AI: #[LOGO]. He is the catalyst to this adventure.

Here, in #[V-OS], a construct universe, they've decided to create a home for other travellers, an archive for their findings, and a platform through which to unravel the mysteries behind the unusual sectors of existence.
