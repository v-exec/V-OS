I'm #[Victor] [vi], and I'm a multidisciplinary designer and developer in Montreal. I currently study Computation Arts at Concordia University, and work as a freelance designer and developer.
+
+
I've worked as a web designer at @[Arthem.co>https://www.facebook.com/arthemco/], game design teacher at Dawson College, research assistant at @[Obx Labs>http://www.obxlabs.net/], and a teaching assistant at Concordia University for the Computation Arts program.

Shortly after the timely revival, my remaining functional fragments urged me to begin my quest. I set out on a journey to acquire knowledge, understand the constituents of the #[Multiverse], and deconstruct the physical realm in an attempt to see what lurks behind the panels.
+
+
Through my voyage, whether it be through skill or pure luck, I've met one of the AI: #[LOGO]. As strange as our relationship might be, he is the catalyst to this adventure, and my primary means of acquiring data.
+
+
Here, in #[V-OS], a construct universe, I've decided to create a home for other travellers, an archive for my findings, and a platform through which to unravel the mysteries behind the unusual sectors of existence.
