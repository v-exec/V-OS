![Summary]

My name is #[Victor] [vi], and I'm a multidisciplinary designer and developer residing both in Montreal and Tokyo.
+
+
I design, develop, and produce media, especially new / experimental media that challenges and innovates on existing products. Projects involving design (2D graphics, touch-ups, UI, branding, web, 3D modeling, 3D rendering, game design), audio (music and sound effect production), programming (fullstack web, game), and teaching any of the aformentioned skills, are all within my capacity.
+
+
As a designer, my goal is to create engaging products that are aesthetically pleasing, unique and innovative, and relevant to your objectives. Whether it be a website, an experimental game, a song, or a graphic for your brand, the purpose is to enable your business to better communicate what you offer, and how well you do it, to your clients. My goal is to accomplish that through high-quality production, as well as conversations with you on how to realize your objectives.
+
+
As an instructor, my goal is to take students from beginner to proficient in any discipline by focusing on mastering the basics. Expertise is a result of in-depth understanding of the fundamentals, combined with practice. Practice is something students must undertake themselves. But, instructing the fundamentals is a responsability I enjoy taking on through fun, engaging, and personal teaching settings.

There, I acted as a technical lead and instructor in the field of game design and audio. I was also involved in teaching programming in C# in Unity over the course of the 1 month workshop. I created and taught the curriculum for audio production, narrative design, and a portion of the programming section. I also helped students (~15 in total) collectively create a game that they had conceptualized. My help ranged from 3D work in Blender, to audio production, to programming in C#, to version control troubleshooting.
