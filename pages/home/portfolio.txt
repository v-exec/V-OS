![Work Experience]

In the past, I've worked as:
+
+
+ A technical lead and instructor for the sixth installment of the @[Skins Workshop>http://abtec.org/iif/workshops/skins-video-game-workshop/], in collaboration with @[Abtec>http://abtec.org/] / @[IFF>http://abtec.org/iif/] / @[Obx Labs>http://www.obxlabs.net/].
+
+
There, I acted as a technical lead and instructor in the field of game design and audio. I was also involved in teaching programming in C# in Unity over the course of the 1 month workshop. I created and taught the curriculum for audio production, narrative design, and a portion of the programming section. I also helped students (~15 in total) collectively create a game that they had conceptualized. My help ranged from 3D work in Blender, to audio production, to programming in C#, to version control troubleshooting.
+
+
+ A programming teaching assistant at @[Concordia University>https://www.concordia.ca/] for the Computation Arts program.
+
+
There, I helped teach university students how to code in Java and work on personal projects.
+
+
+ A research assistant at @[Obx Labs>http://www.obxlabs.net/] working on virtual reality and typography.
+
+
There, I conceptualized and produced experimental typography projects using both Unity and Unreal Engine for use with the HTC Vive.
+
+
+ A game design teacher at @[Dawson College>https://www.dawsoncollege.qc.ca/].
+
+
There, I created and taught a 2-week full-time curriculum centered around familiarizing students with game design, and helping each student produce a personal game using Construct 2.
+
+
+ A web designer at @[Arthem.co>https://www.facebook.com/arthemco/].
+
+
There, I dealt with client requiremnts and front-end design of websites.
