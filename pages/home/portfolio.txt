I'm #[Victor] [vi], and I'm a multidisciplinary designer and developer currently residing in Montreal. I design, develop, and produce static and interactive media in various forms, including #[visual], #[audio], and #[code]. My technical focus is primarily rooted in using code to create _[unique, innovative, aesthetically powerful, polished, and engaging media]. Both my educational and professional life has been oriented towards building a capable set of technical skills in a variety of media, all the while developing an eye for aesthetics.

As both an artist and developer, it's important for me to keep myself engaged in both the worlds of art and coding. Thankfully, I've been able to find many opportunities to put my skills to use, especially in the realms of 3D graphics and games. It is my goal to continue learning new skills and to put my existing ones to use on each project.

As for my personal projects, they typically feature a major narrative element. I am heavily inspired by cyberpunk media, and I try to craft narratives focused on philosophical exploration and the ways in which technology can be a narrative catalyst for these topics.
