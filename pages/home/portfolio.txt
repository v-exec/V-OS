![Summary]

My name is #[Victor] [vi], and I'm a multidisciplinary designer and developer residing both in Montreal and Tokyo.
+
+
I design, develop, and produce static and interactive media. I work with @[graphics>visual] (2D graphics, editing, UI, branding, web, 3D modeling, 3D rendering, animation), #[audio] (music and sound effect production), and @[programming>code] (fullstack web, game). Using this skillset, my goal is to create _[unique, innovative, aesthetically powerful, and engaging media] to materialize a project's vision - _[to tell a story].
+
+
For businesses, I offer branding consultation, as well as brand design and platform development.
+
+
For studios, I offer 2D and 3D asset production (textures, models, rigs, environments, concept art, user interfacing), audio production (effects and music), as well as art direction, game design, and interaction programming.
+
+
As the digital art industry has adopted more mixed media production techniques in the past decades, my skills have become increasingly relevant. My abilities allow me to be both comfortable using a single medium if necessary, as well as combining multiple media in order to work significantly more rapidly and efficiently. All the while, communication between different experts is seamless, given my experience in varied fields. Ultimately, these skills are a means to an end: to tell a story in its most impactful form.
+
+
With that said, I look forward to putting my skillset towards making our vision into a reality.

![Experience]

I studied in Montreal, graduating with first class honors from Interactive Media Arts in Dawson College. Currently, I study Computation Arts at Concordia University in Montreal, as well as Waseda University in Tokyo.
+
+
What follows is my work experience.

Technical lead and instructor for the sixth installment of the @[Skins Workshop>http://abtec.org/iif/workshops/skins-video-game-workshop/], in collaboration with @[Abtec>http://abtec.org/] / @[IFF>http://abtec.org/iif/] / @[Obx Labs>http://www.obxlabs.net/].
+
+
There, I acted as a technical lead and instructor in the field of game design and audio. I was also involved in teaching programming in C# in Unity over the course of the 1 month workshop. I created and taught the curriculum for audio production, narrative design, and a portion of the programming section. I also helped students (~15 in total) collectively create a game that they had conceptualized. My help ranged from 3D work in Blender, to audio production, to programming in C#, to version control management.
