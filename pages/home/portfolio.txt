I'm #[Victor] [vi], and I'm a multidisciplinary designer and developer currently residing in Montreal. I design, develop, and produce static and interactive media. I work with a variety of media, mainly:
+
+
@[Graphics>visual] - 2D graphics, video, UI, branding, photography, 3D modeling, rendering, effects, and animation. Using tools like Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere, Lightroom, Blender, Houdini, Metashape, Substance Designer and Painter, and Marvelous Designer.
+
+
#[Audio] - Music and effect production. Using tools like Ableton, acoustic and electric guitar, and keyboard.
+
+
@[Programming>code] - Back and front end web development, game scripting, and shaders. Using languages like PHP, Javascript, CSS, HLSL, C#, and tools like NodeJS and Unity.
+
+
My goal is to create _[unique, innovative, aesthetically powerful, polished, and engaging media] to materialize a project's vision - _[to tell a story]. My personal interest is most focused on philosophical exploration, and the ways in which technology can be a narrative catalyst for these topics.
+
+
As an artist and producer, what I find most vital to a project is its narrative. Every story is best told through different and varied media. For this reason, I've developed a large breadth of technical skills which all conceptually relate to my desire and ability to tell varied stories effectively. My passion is learning new skills, and putting my existing ones to use on each project - to tell a good story how it's meant to be told.
