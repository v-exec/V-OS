I'm Victor [vi], and I'm a multidisciplinary designer and developer currently residing in Montreal. I've studied Computation Arts at Concordia University in Montreal and Waseda University in Tokyo, and often work as a developer and technical artist for games, publicity, web, and installation art. 
+
+
I design, develop, and produce static and interactive media in various forms, including #[visual], #[audio], and #[code]. My technical focus is primarily rooted in using code to create _[unique, innovative, aesthetically powerful, polished, and imaginative] media.
+
+
I've been fortunate enough to find many opportunities to put both my artistic and programming skills to use across the realm of 3D visuals, and feel like the world of graphics - whether it be realtime or prerending - offers endlessly engaging challenges that balance technical expertise and artistic expression.
+
+
I try to keep my traditional art skillsets sharp by producing a lot of personal work, with many of my projects typically featuring a major narrative factor. I craft stories focused on alternate realities and fictional worlds where technology is used as a narrative catalyst to explore the human condition.
