I'm Victor [vi], and I'm a multidisciplinary designer and developer currently residing in Montreal. I work as a developer and technical artist for games, publicity, web, and art installations.
+
+
I design, develop, and produce static and interactive media, with my technical focus primarily rooted in using code to create _[unique, innovative, aesthetically powerful, polished, and imaginative] media.
+
+
In my 5 years of experience, I've put my artistic and programming skills to use across the realm of 3D visuals, tackling challenges in realtime and offline rendering that balance technical expertise and artistic expression.
If you're looking to build beautiful and performant interactive media that leverages custom-built tools and an efficient art production and integration pipeline, please get in touch.
+
+
I also try to keep my traditional art skillsets sharp by producing a lot of personal work, found in the #[projects] page. I craft stories focused on alternate realities and fictional worlds where technology is used as a narrative catalyst to explore the human condition.
