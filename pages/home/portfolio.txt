I'm #[Victor] [vi], and I'm a multidisciplinary designer and developer currently residing in Montreal. I design, develop, and produce static and interactive media in various forms, including #[visual], #[audio], and #[code]. My technical focus is primarily rooted in using code to create _[unique, innovative, aesthetically powerful, polished, and imaginative media]. My aim is to use my capable set of technical skills and eye for aesthetics to create imagination-sparking experiences.

+
I've been fortunate enough to find many opportunities to put both my artistic and programming skills to use, especially in the realms of 3D graphics and games. It is my goal to continue learning new skills and to put my existing ones to use on each project.
+
+
I also produce a lot of personal work, with my projects typically featuring a major narrative element. I am heavily inspired by cyberpunk media, and I try to craft narratives focused on philosophical exploration and the ways in which technology can be a narrative catalyst for these topics.
