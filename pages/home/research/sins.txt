title: The #[Sins], combatting human nature.
content:
Like every other human on (and off) this planet, we have imperfections. Some of them minor, others more extreme. For those seeking self-improvement (and I do hope that applies to most people), a natural desire is to minimize these imperfections and become versions of ourselves that produce more positive results in the world, and in turn, live more fulfilling lives.

I have felt, in myself, that a great source of these imperfections come from my desires. This post will discuss the struggles of combatting one's unhealthy desires, and I will use many examples from my own life. This is a somewhat intimate topic for me, but I hope that opening up will help you, the reader, feel more open with yourself, and hopefully encourage you to reflect on your own desires and how some of them may be unhealthy.

Seeking perfect partners is futile, and it's best to take care of yourself first as you're your only parter for life.
