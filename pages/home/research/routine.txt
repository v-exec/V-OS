title: #[Routine] is a set of routines for lifestyle maintenance.
content:

In highschool, my goal was to escape routine out of sheer boredom. I hated school, and I hated having to do the same thing every day. I've developed a slightly more nuanced view of routine since then and felt the positive benefits of keeping a healthy routine. With this page, I'd like to formalize a small and simple set of routines, or perhaps better referred to as _[habits], to keep me on a track towards a nicer lifestyle.

As I've said in my thoughts on #[timekeeping], writing stuff down has proved incredibly useful in making me more proactive. Therefore, the following routines' goals are to make it easier for me to manage my health and time investment long-term by planning out a well-documented set of things I should do each and every day.
