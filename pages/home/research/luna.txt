Artists are encouraged to create art that is not traditionally exhibited in a gallery: Writing, programs, games, tools, algorithms, music, etc. The web environment allows these pieces to be embedded into the gallery, with the aim of diversifying the forms of media that can be exhibited.

Additionally, artists are encouraged to equally focus on the documentation of their project through textual support of their piece. This reflection on their work ties in with the philosophical investigation of each month's theme.
