title: The #[research] section is the space destined for my research, and personal inquiries.
content:
The pages in #[research] serve both as a public repository for anyone who's interested in reading about some of the philosophies I follow (as painfully egotistical as that feels), as well as a place for me to revisit when I feel lost and in need of a reminder on wha's important to me.
