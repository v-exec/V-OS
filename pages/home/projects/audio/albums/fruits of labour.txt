@[Fruits of Labour>https://www.opheliaspinosa.com/fruitsoflabour] is a short documentary directed by @[Ophelia Spinosa>https://www.opheliaspinosa.com/].

?[Interplaying the metaphor of grapes, this father-daughter documentary is characterized by the labour of love it is to make wine, but also the labour of love that is love itself.]

My main role was based around scoring the movie with key pieces of music and motifs. During this project, I worked closely with Ophelia to determine instrumentation, composition, timing, and mixing.

The soundtrack features orchestral instruments in lo-fi soundscapes, with slight usage of electronic elements. It outlines the relationship between father and daughter, and explores both the bitter and sweet sides of the particularities of their connection.
