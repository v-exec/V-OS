I worked at Dpt on various projects as a technical artist, producing content in collaboration with and for clients like Meta, Jeld-Wen, NASA, Mandai Wildlife Reserve, Felix & Paul, and Calgary Stampede.

As a technical artist, my work involved programming and asset integration in Unity, Unreal, and web platforms, as well as asset production through Maya, Blender, the Substance and Adobe suites, and others.

The skillsets most commonly leveraged for my tasks revolved around art pipeline development, rigging, asset optimization, shader development, VFX production, rendering optimization, client requirements, and technical documentation.
