I worked on this Unity project as a technical artist with the goal of creating visual representations of procedrually generated content, as well as helping define the map generation system for simulation purposes.
+
+
This includes architecting and developing - all procedurally - island data and biome generation, 3D mesh generation and texturing, map decor and object population, 2D asset matching for character and environment representation.

I also created a simple @[blog website>https://www.lablablab.net//chroniqueur/] to help with public documentation of the project's progress.
