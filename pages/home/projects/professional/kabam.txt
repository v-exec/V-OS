I worked at Kabam on a handful of Unity games as a technical artist, filling whatever gaps were present at the studio. My primary focus was Shadows of Valdora (cancelled), where I:
+
+
- overhauled the lighting system in all scenes, optimizing performance while bringing higher graphical fidelity and acting as a lighting artist.
+
+
- managed and wrote documentation across both art and development teams.
+
+
- created and utilized tools for project organization.
+
+
- created tools for artists to test and validate assets.
+
+
- acted as a bridge between artists and developers in regards to new technical features, technical constraints, and artistic control.
+
+
- monitored performance and followed up with optimization passes on assets and inefficient rendering systems.
+
+
- supported artists with various technical needs, both in regards to artistic processes in their production suites, as well as technical support for their machines.
+
+
- dealt with graphics-related bugs and inconsistencies across the production.
+
+
- set up and managed cutscene systems.
+
+
- helped animators with rig and animation optimizations and integration.
+
+
- assisted graphics programmers in designing, integrating, and documenting new shaders and graphics technologies - especially those interacted with by artists.
+
+
- integrated assets.
+
+
- produced and integrated VFX.
+
+
- defined and communicated new practices and techniques to refine the art production pipeline.

During downtime, I helped the Shop Titans(shipped & live ops) team with similar tasks.

After Shadows of Valdora's cancellation, I focused on look dev (with an emphasis on technical implementations), rendering techniques, and designing and prototyping new art-tech for an unannounced title.
