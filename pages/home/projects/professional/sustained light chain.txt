My role for this project involved creating tools and systems in Unity to help Lucas produce the set-pieces and visuals of his performance through a VR interface, as well as interfacing with OSC output streams from his own systems.

![Lucas' Artist Statement]

?[
The AV performance Sustained Light Chain is a digital environment of complexity fusing textures of morphing light, signal networks, chain reactions and virtual botany into a real time audiovisual instrument.
+
+
The technique behind the work was inspired by ecosystem activity, exponentiality, mycelium, permaculture, bio-design and the ways we are navigating contemporary choices in a context of climate change. It also stems from the efforts of creating a virtual environment and its rules with a conscious effort to move the use of game engines beyond adversity, conflict, attack, evaluation and reward, and towards care, reflection, attention and perception.
+
+
The work embraces fluidity between virtual and real, and between human technicality and nature.
