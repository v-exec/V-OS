This library was inspired by Borges' @[Library of Babel>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Library_of_Babel], and the @[Library of Babel Website>https://libraryofbabel.info/]. It was made in Unreal Engine 4 in an effort to create a digital version of the library that allows the user to explore a quasi-infinite environment of randomly generated text.

This environment aims to position the user in a world where text is no longer a guaranteed container for meaning, but a structural element of reality. Through exploration of this universe, the user may come accross snippets of coherent phrases, rare instances of sensical data.

In terms of additions, #[Ontologica] could be expanded to be a persistent, shared world. Players could highlight text, allowing others to explore areas of interest heavily marked by others, or entirely uncharted territories with no highlights whatsoever, creating a large-scale exploration game in a digital library of randomness.
