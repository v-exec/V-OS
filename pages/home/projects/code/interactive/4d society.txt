content:

Inspired by games like @[Memories of a Broken Dimension>https://store.steampowered.com/app/544300/Memory_of_a_Broken_Dimension/], @[Fugue In Void>https://moshelinke.itch.io/fugue-in-void], and @[NaissanceE>https://store.steampowered.com/app/265690/NaissanceE/], #[4D SOCIETY] explores environments filled with large-scale brutalist architecture, disorienting and experimental graphics, and a narrative with questions surrounding philosophical ideology.
