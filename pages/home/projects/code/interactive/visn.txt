#[VisN] puts players in an environment with a few lines of text, and four manipulatable ‘frames’. These frames each show a slightly altered vision of reality. More specifically, each frame showcases a different piece of text. With each frame having its own unique set of visible texts, this setup encourages players to explore different interpretations of a reading through the combination, splicing, and juxtaposition of different phrases.
