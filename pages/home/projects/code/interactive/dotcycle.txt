title: #[DotCycle] is a narrative game taking place in archived memories of an #[atomic AI].
content: ?[Operator, this is the most intact instance so far. I think it's our best chance at understanding why they keep offing themselves.]

#[DotCycle] is a recorded exploration of archived memories from one of the last unsuccessful #[atomic AI]. Composed from poetry, music, and environments that coalesce into a representation of the subject's most remarkable memories.

?[True AI is just around the corner, but we just need to correct a few final details. Each experiment seems so promising at first, but within a few seconds it all shuts down - and we think it's deliberate. The team just put the final touches on the remote access unit, and you're going in.]

Explore these archived memories, and learn of the AI's revalations about sentience, free of will, and purpose.
