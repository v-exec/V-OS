#[Jagged Orbit] is a music video for Halftribe & Spinnet's @[Jagged Orbit>https://synphaera.bandcamp.com/track/jagged-orbit]. It tells a story of the creation of a world both unique, and simultaneously familiar - from the physical forces that manifested it, to its eventual fall to entropy.

This project was created using photogrammetry of landscape videos taken with a drone, which were then used as force fields for various particle systems.
