content: #[Cord] is a 3D visualization of musical data.

&[cord>2]

A selection of songs is mapped to a cube, each vertex of which represents an emotion or mood. A questionnaire is conducted for each song to measure which emotions it evokes. Its location in the cube is a weighted average of these emotions.
+
+
Each song's chord progression for verse and chorus (or whatever is estimated as structural equivalents), bpm, and genre is retrieved from @[Hook Theory's chord progression database>https://www.hooktheory.com/theorytab].
+
+
This information aims to display user preferences and trends. In future versions with simplified data collection, this can be used to study and analyse large groups of songs simultaneously and in relation to one another.
