#[Nakade] was created for @[Synchrony 2020>https://synchrony.nyc/2020/] in an 11-hour train ride from New York to Montreal, winning first place in the Demo category.

The project was created in collaboration with @[Simon Demeule>https://simondemeule.com/], who took the role of graphics programmer for point cloud rendering, point cloud manipulation, post processing effects, and scene management.
