title: #[Delta] is a collection of customizable, live webcam and kinect-cam filters.

The original set of filters was created using Processing, and they were later recreated in a @[standalone app>media/downloads/delta/Delta_windows.zip] using Unity, written to work much more efficiently on the GPU.
