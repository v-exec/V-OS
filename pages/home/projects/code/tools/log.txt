The purpose of the #[Log] is to study my work habits, spot patterns in the types of activities I engage in, and attempt to optimize my productivity. I've written about my design intent with the #[Log] in #[timekeeping]. #[Timekeeping] also covers design decisions I found interesting in regards to the #[Log], challenges I faced during its development, and the benefits it's brought to my lifestyle.
