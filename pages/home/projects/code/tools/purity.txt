title: #[Purity] is an authoring engine that acts as the back-end of #[V-OS].
content: #[Purity] is a specialized wiki engine built in PHP, with the purpose of creating a minimalistic platform for complex, interwoven networks of data.
+
+
#[Purity] allows for elaborate connectivity between its object-based data structures (made easily accessible from a user standpoint with the help of Apache's URI rewriting system), intuitive writing as a result of its multi-layered parser, and generalized usage due to its functional usage as a content management system, and even a text-based game engine.
+

Its markup language is based on a simple syntax. It contains _[attributes], which are declared through the attribute name, followed by a colon, and the information to be attributed to said attribute.

~[name : text
image : directory>imagename
etc.
]

And it contains _[rules], which are inline elements used to format text according to predetermined functions.

~[= [tag] link list
= [text ++ text0] compact custom list
! [text] subtitle
# [local link]
etc.
