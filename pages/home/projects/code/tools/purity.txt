Technical documentation is available on @[Github>https://github.com/v-exec/Purity]. #[Purity] aims to be a plug-and-play application, requiring nothing but a WAMP/LAMP setup (for local usage) / PHP-supported hosting, and the contents of its repository.
+
+
#[Purity] is also capable of generating static sites. For situations where PHP-supported hosting is unavailable, WAMP/LAMP can create a set of HTML files, fully ready to deploy.

#[Purity] allows for elaborate connectivity between its object-based data structures, easy navigation with the help of Apache's URI rewriting system, intuitive writing as a result of its multi-layered parser, and varied  usage due to its functional capacities as a content management system, and even a text-based game engine.

Its markup language is based on a simple syntax. It contains _[attributes], which are declared through the attribute name, followed by a colon, and the information to be attributed to said attribute.

~[name : text
image : directory>imagename
etc.
]

And it contains _[rules], which are inline elements used to format text according to predetermined functions.

~[= [tag] link list
= [text ++ text0] compact custom list
! [text] subtitle
# [local link]
etc.
