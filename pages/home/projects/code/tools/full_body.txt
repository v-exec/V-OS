#[Full-body] randomizes your exercise sequence, gives you generated text for each supported movement, shows you your progress, tracks time spent on particular muscle groups / target areas / exercises per workout, and displays that information in the end. It's simple, but practical for anyone looking to worry less about the order of their routine.
