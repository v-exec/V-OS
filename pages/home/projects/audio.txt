I make my audio work primarily using Ableton as a DAW, with my Nektar Impact LX 61 as a midi controller. I also have experience with FL Studio and Logic Pro, but prefer Ableton, as its UI and functionality suits my workflow.

I synthesize all of my audio, aside from drum samples. For sound synthesis, I use synths like Massive, IL Harmor, and a bunch of VSTs I've found on the web. Some of my projects also involve synthesis through programming with frameworks like MaxMSP, PureData, and Tone.js.

Most of my music doesn't feature acoustic instruments, however I've played guitar for over a decade, and a bit of piano.
