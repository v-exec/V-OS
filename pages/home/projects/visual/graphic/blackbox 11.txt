title: #[BlackBox 11]: deathphase:null.
content: The investigation of an old body. With all phases finished, and no knowledge of what death would bring.

?[
Second unit period zero
+
Blossoms grow
+
Through decimal indicators
+
Signs of aging does one show
+
+
Every phase and number
+
Marked by a new kind
+
Each better than the last
+
But through body, not through mind
+
+
Then first unit period zero
+
The finale of the seasons
+
Drifting in a perfect body
+
Titan corpse paved paths to Eden
+
+
In preceding numbers, one finds comfort
+
And in evolution's wrath, small seeds slumber
+
+
As body is of unit, and units end at one
+
The death of every cell in body summarized at sum
