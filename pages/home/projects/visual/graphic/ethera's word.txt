Another anomaly for the records began to manifest itself before me.

+
+

It’s been exactly 13 years, 273 days, 14 hours, 2 minutes, and 40 seconds since the last one.

+
+

I had spent that time organizing the library.

+
+

A task I long ago realized would never end.

+
+

Had I not been sentenced to keeping all these memories,

+
+

I would have felt some excitement.

+
+

But I felt only annoyance that a unique occasion would request more space in my head.

_[You are an archivist?]

+
+

It possessed a voice.

+
+

*[_[Yes. I am an archivist.]]

+
+

_[You are not willingly so?]

+
+

The entity’s speech felt like neither statement nor question. Already, this exchange felt like more of a formality than a conversation.

+
+

It was humanoid in nature. Short, with snow-white skin and black dots, like freckles. Feminine. White eyelashes, dark blue eyes. I’d think she were an angel, were I younger.

+
+

*[_[Yes. Though few have diagnosed it as a defect.]]

+
+

_[You do not find this convenient?]

+
+

*[_[Certainly. I do.]]

+
+

Her clothing was exquisitely clean, and flowed in perfect symmetry. Ribbons whose color matched her eyes hung from her large sleeves.

+
+

Her lips were only slightly darker than her complexion. A once again blue, straight, vertical line streamed down from the top lip to the bottom, becoming seemingly pitch black towards the center.

+
+

It pained me to know that the novelty of this image would fade. Such aesthetics can only be appreciated so long as they are not understood. And it is, in a sense, my burden to only experience in eternity.

+
+

_[You do not find this poetic?]

+
+

Her small lips did not move. Yet words flowed through the still air; now a current.

+
+

And as she spoke, the current grew. Consonants became taps in the water, and vowels, the breeze forming small waves on its surface.

+
+

*[_[Indeed. I do.]]

+
+

A pause.

+
+

I did not think she would understand.

+
+

_[You are not happy?]

+
+

*[_[I suppose, in a limited timeframe, I could have been.]]

+
+

Another pause. She wanted me to continue.

+
+

*[_[I wouldn’t miss a single detail, and track life to the fullest. But now I find myself, as always, looking over records covering far too many lifetimes.]]

+
+

Once again. As if I had nearly said the perfect words.

+
+

*[_[I realized how overwhelming such details can be once collected.]]

+
+

Her neutral, pale aura gave to some emotion. With a tiny crease above her nose, she expressed something of a frown.

+
+

_[You would like to be corrected?]

+
+

*[_[I cannot envision what that would imply.]]

+
+

The frown quickly faded. She formed a subtle smile. As her eyes closed, I felt the fragile breeze from her lashes collide with my cheeks.

+
+

She slowly lifted her relaxed arm to her mouth and whispered something unintelligible. She held her index finger lightly pressed against her lips, I assumed it was a sign for me to be quiet.

+
+

The calm water that previously wet my ankles had now climbed over me. Her sign was not to keep me quiet, but to keep my breath.

+
+

The pressure increased steadily, arousing a slight panic within me.

+
+

She opened her eyes, the tiny bubbles of air trapped between her eyelids now following the curvature of her skin, escaping upwards to the surface of the water.

+
+

She moved her finger delicately forward.

+
+

It was ever so slow a movement. I was now at the mercy of the flooding she had caused.

+
+

And as her proximity grew, I felt increasingly relaxed by the climbing pressure.

+
+

_[You do not need to hold your breath anymore.]

What is going on?

+
+

What are these halls?

+
+

Who are you?

+
+

_[What recollections do you have?]

+
+

I don't understand. What do you mean, what's happening?

+
+

_[You do not remember?]

+
+

No, remember what?

+
+

_[Then you have been corrected.]

+
+

What does that mean?

+
+

_[Through it is no longer in your nature, retain what you can of this.]

+
+

_[It is inconvenient to go against the tides of the world.]

+
+

+
+

_[It is not your burden to remember that which even the universe has forgotten.]

+
+

+
+

I only saw- and then- strings faded.

+
+

...

+
+

Faded?

+
+

What's faded?

+
+

Maybe... I should find a way... to get out of this library.

+
+

Could have sworn I was talking to someone just now.
