Another anomaly for the records began to manifest itself before me.

+
+

13 years, 273 days, 14 hours, 2 minutes, and 40 seconds since the last one.

+
+

And still, this library remains disorganized.

+
+

Had I not been sentenced to keeping all these memories,

+
+

I would have felt some excitement.

+
+

But I felt only annoyance that a unique occasion would request more space in my head.

_[You are an archivist?]

+
+

It speaks.

+
+

*[_[Yes. I am an archivist.]]

+
+

_[You are not willingly so?]

+
+

The entity’s speech felt like neither statement nor question. Already, this exchange felt like more of a formality than a conversation.

+
+

It was humanoid in nature. Short, with snow-white skin and black dots, like freckles. Feminine. White eyelashes, dark blue eyes. Angelic in presnece, but I'd seen angels. She was not one.

+
+

*[_[I am not an archivist by choice, no.]]

+
+

As far as I can tell, no one would be, had they a foresight as refined as their retrospection.

+
+

_[You do not find it convenient?]

+
+

*[_[Certainly. I do.]]

+
+

Her clothing was exquisitely clean, and flowed in perfect symmetry. Ribbons whose color matched her eyes hung from her large sleeves.

+
+

Her lips were only slightly darker than her complexion. A once again blue, straight, vertical line streamed down from the top lip to the bottom, becoming seemingly pitch black towards the center.

+
+

It pained me to know that the novelty of this image would fade. There was a certain aesthetic quality to this moment, and such aesthetics can only be appreciated so long as our exposure to them is limited.

+
+

_[You do not find it poetic?]

+
+

Her small lips did not move. Yet words flowed through the still air; now a current.

+
+

And as she spoke, the current grew. Consonants became taps in a pool of water, and vowels, the breeze forming small waves on its surface.

+
+

*[_[What does it matter?]]

+
+

A pause.

+
+

The water, now at my ankles, completely still.

+
+

_[You are not happy?]

+
+

*[_[I suppose, in a limited timeframe, I could have been.]]

+
+

Another pause. She wanted me to continue.

+
+

*[_[I wouldn’t miss a single detail, and track life to the fullest. But now I find myself, as always, looking over records covering far too many lifetimes.]]

+
+

Once again. As if I had nearly said the perfect words.

+
+

*[_[I realized how overwhelming such details can be once collected.]]

+
+

Her neutral aura gave to some emotion. With a tiny crease above her nose, she expressed something of a frown.

+
+

_[You would like to be corrected?]

+
+

*[_[I cannot envision what that would imply.]]

+
+

The frown quickly faded. She formed a subtle smile. As her eyes closed, I felt the fragile breeze begin anew.

+
+

She slowly lifted her relaxed arm to her mouth and whispered something unintelligible. She held her index finger lightly pressed against her lips, I assumed it was a sign for me to be quiet.

+
+

The calm water that previously wet my ankles had now climbed over me. Her sign was not to keep my silence, but to keep my breath.

+
+

The pressure increased steadily, causing a small panic. For a short moment, my mind was filled with a focus that tore my attention away from pasts revisited.

+
+

She opened her eyes, the tiny bubbles of air trapped between her eyelids now following the curvature of her skin, escaping upwards to the surface of the water.

+
+

She moved her finger delicately forward.

+
+

And as her proximity grew, I felt increasingly relaxed by the climbing pressure.

+
+

_[You do not need to hold your breath anymore.]

What's going on?

+
+

Who are you?

+
+

_[What recollections do you have?]

+
+

What does that mean, what's happening?

+
+

_[You do not remember?]

+
+

No? Remember what?

+
+

_[Then you have been corrected.]

+
+

What does that mean?

+
+

_[Though it is no longer in your nature, retain what you can of this.]

+
+

_[It is inconvenient to go against the tides of the world.]

+
+

_[It is not your burden to remember that which even the universe has forgotten.]

I only saw... and then... strings faded.

+
+

...

+
+

Faded?

+
+

...

+
+

What's faded?

+
+

...

+
+

Maybe... I should find a way to... to get out of this library.

+
+

Could've sworn I was talking to someone just now.
