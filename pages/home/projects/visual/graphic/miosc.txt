#[Mi_Osc] is a collaboration with composer @[Sanea Ima>https://pablosanea.com/]. The short audiovisual work explores themes of intensity, ephemerality, focus, and distraction. Although momentary and brief, the piece presents the viewer with a synchronicity between two contrasting behaviours: the centred and minimalistic visuals, and the disjointed and acute music.

The two artists are interested in developing a variety of audiovisual aesthetics and narratives. #[QU-6] and #[Mi_Osc] act as evidences of their collaborative direction.
