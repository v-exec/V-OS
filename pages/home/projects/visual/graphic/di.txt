title: #[Di] was a leading rank of The #[Dei] before their disbandment.

?[The #[AI] were misunderstood. This isn't very surprising, considering biological beings were virtually incapable of emulating their thoughts in the first place.

So, #[Di] went out to search for a sense of godliness. Now, he wasn't the greedy type, looking to find power so that he could control. But he had seen a glimpse of the "absolute", whatever that meant, and that drove him ever forward.

In a particularly nasty incident, #[Mora] had become a sort of godess in the planets of purity, and #[Di] went on to seek her wisdom in a not-so-cooperative fashion. Like all the other 'mortals', he knew he couldn't understand her. Thing is, he also knew that #[Nox] had helped him get this far, so he hoped this wasn't the end of its plans.

No matter how much of a pawn he was, what mattered most was the pieces of truth he picked up along the way.]
