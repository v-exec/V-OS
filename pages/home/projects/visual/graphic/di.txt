title: #[Di] was a leading rank of The #[Dei] before their disbandment.
content:

?[The #[AI] were misunderstood. Not very surprising, considering all us fleshy ones can't even emulate their thoughts in the first place.
+
+
So, #[Di] went out to search for a sense of godliness in his misunderstandingment. He wasn't the greedy type like 'em usuals. But, he had seen a glimpse of the "absolute", whatever that meant, and that drove him.
+
+
Y'see, #[Mora] had become a sort of goddess in the planets of the purity, and #[Di] went on to seek her wisdom in a not-so-cooperative fashion-like. He knew he couldn't understand her, but thing is, he also knew that #[Nox] had helped him get this far. So, boy is hoped this wasn't the end of his plans.
+
+
Didn't see him afterwards no more. But I've been hearing he's good.
+
+
No matter how much of a pawn he was, what mattered most was the pieces of truth he picked up along the way.]
