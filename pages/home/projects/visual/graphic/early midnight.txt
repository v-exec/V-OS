title: An #[Early Midnight] is the predecessor intrasuit to the #[Successor Series] project.
content: 

Made as extensions to human form, Early Midnights walked among people as another step towards the future. Originally used to make up for physical disabilities, they evolved to interface with their host human's cerebellum.

Hardware and software advances in the coming decades saw this technology take off in unprecedented areas - interfacing with larger and higher functioning regions of the brain, allowing for cognitive and physical abilities beyond unaltered humans. The result eventually grew into the Successor Series.

The same underlying technology was used to create the #[Toriyomu].

/[Toriyomu]

These helmets were procedurally modeled in their entirety in Houdini. Texture maps were produced in Substance Designer, and materials and rendering were done in Blender.

Heavily inspired by @[Fernando Magalhaes>http://mgxs.co/]' procedural generation.
