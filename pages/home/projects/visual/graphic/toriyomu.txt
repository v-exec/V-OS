title: The #[Toriyomu] are semi-organic vehicles used by the @[Early Midnights>Early Midnight].
content: 

Created from the same underlying technology as the @[Early Midnights>Early Midnight], the Toriyomu are a mix between hera flesh (a subspecies of horse), some hera neural tissue, and the nano symbiote that interfaces with neural tissue.
+
+
The symbiote requires neural tissue as a source, but in time is able to grow mechanical components within and around this tissue, producing full bodies of non-organic material interlaced with organic tissue.
+
+
With the exception of some rare cases, unaltered humans cannot operate the Toriyomu as they require a cerebral interface to pilot. Naturally, this leaves @[Early Midnights>Early Midnight] as the primary operators.

These meshes were procedurally modeled in their entirety in Houdini. Texture maps were produced in Substance Designer, and materials and rendering were done in Blender.

Originally created for racing and high-speed recon missions, early versions of the 200 series fell out of use and are now primarily seen as antique luxury vehicles for collectors.

![Model 614]

Outfitted with heavy armor plating, ion cannons, and an EMF shield, the 600 series is known mostly for its military-oriented purposes. Coloquially known as "the tick", likely a double-entendre regarding both its shape, and (ironically) its size (W:15m, L:25m, H:7.5m).
