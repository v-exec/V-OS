Think of a question or topic you feel has depth worth exploring.
Typically something that's been on your mind a lot lately.
Something beyond trivial matters.

Lay down 3 cards face up, and examine the meaning of these cards both individually, and as a unit.
Does their meaning apply to you and your topic in any way?

Give yourself time to make unlikely connections between the cards and your topic of meditation.
Explore the emerging connections, hopefully coming to new conclusions regarding your topic.
