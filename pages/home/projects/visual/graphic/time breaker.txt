title: The #[Time Breaker] is a sheathe capable of localized temporal distortion.
content:
Last seen in sector 288, Silo Teleport, the #[Time Breaker] is a sheathe created by a now-defunct R&D lab at #[Macro]. It was created as an experimental weapon against #[Nigh Successors] with the help of a far-link to #[Temporalis], giving it its distinct time distortion properties. Unfortunately, the weapon proved too dangerous for users, who often reported extreme nausea, fatigue, and acute psychosis after only brief use.

A lock system was installed on the prototype that authorizes its use exclusively in life-or-death circumstances, which marked the weapon as a failed experiment due to its narrow use-case and safety issues. The sheathe and its sword were reported missing soon after the abandonment of the project. "Good riddance", said chief science officer at a press conference, "whoever decides to use it would die before they could hurt anyone else".

Eons after #[The Sphere]'s era, a ronin was spotted wielding the weapon on a lone moon. Reports claim he was a pilgrim on a hunt to slay the young offspring of a mira fox, an extremely dangerous species that was said to be extinct for millenia at the time.

This short timeframe required many optimizations, which forced me out of the endless perfectionism that plagues some projects. Much of what is out of frame or occluded is very barebones in favor of maximizing detail and quality of what's visible,
the result of which is seen in things like the boss' topology, uneven texel density, and the hero's entire frontside.

Regardless, that pressure made for a very fun and rewarding experience which I'm excited to participate in again!
