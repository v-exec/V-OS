title: A #[Dentatsuna] is a mobile temple, the #[Automata]'s travelling cathedral.
content: A #[Dentatsuna] is the #[Automata]'s interstellar temple and place of residence. As a fundamentally religious species, the #[Automata] engineered large cosmic vehicles destined to act as both modes of transport / residential ships, as well as catalysts for the spread of their #[ARK Simulation].

In order to expand the simulation to a sufficiently large area, a #[Dentatsuna] typically travels for a bit over 4.4E+6 Sol years. It houses a single generation of high-level #[Automata], and maintains an active ecosystem of low-level maintenance #[Automata].

Once the #[ARK Simulation] of a given #[Dentatsuna] is of sufficient size, the ship is abandoned in a remote location, and its residents enter the simulation. In some instances, the #[Dentatsuna]'s chosen location of abandonment allows for its maintenance ecosystem of low-level #[Automata] to persist in their duties. This results in ships continuing their maintenance cycle indefinitely, producing eerie megastructures of perfect cleanliness in otherwise desolate environments.
