In these projects, I produced a large selection of 3D glove models, materials, animations, commercials, and glove assets for realtime visualization and customization in their interactive web viewer. These assets were either used as-is (in the case of commercials and product reveal videos), or in their @[website>https://www.invictusgloves.com/].

Additionally, I handled part of client requirements, project management, and communications with different teams for the web visualization. Technical work and select projects were shared with Vartan Timourdjian.
