At first, things were difficult. A language I didn't speak, a half-assed effort to fit into the foreign social protocols of a vastly different society, and no friends or acquaintances.
+
+
Even among other international students I realized how varied peoples' values were. We tend to surround ourselves with the same set of people in our own bubble. In my case, these were artists, designers, and coders.
+
+
But in Japan, I met with people from all walks of life; ones that didn't care much for my hobbies or art.
I was used to sharing a portfolio and website as a conversation starter. Without that, I was left wondering how to find common ground.
+
+
But what began as a social challenge became the greatest blessing.

Productivity is all I cared for. But, in Japan, the way of life was simpler. Time didn't quite move as much, and the present remained in clear sight.
+
+
In my world, all we spoke about were projects, work, and careers.
+
+
But in Japan, among the friends I made, I faced a world where traditional career achievements mattered as little as they should.
Along with them, I let go of the burdens and anxieties that plague a reality where your worth is determined by anonymous followers and social validation.
+
+
I haven't let go of productivity, but now it shares my mental space with other fulfillment-breeding habits.
The struggle is never-ending, but each day spent focusing on what one enjoys doing is a step closer to stripping your happiness away from the hands of others and claiming it for yourself.

I yearn now for what I had in Japan.
+
+
The awkward handshakes and shy smiles of new acquaintences.
+
+
The late-night conbini runs, evenings out in the park, and nighttime conversations about the world and life.
+
+
The passionate professors who spoke with conviction about syntax, architecture, and games.
+
+
The rehearsals and live shows in tiny venues and warm crowds.
+
+
The trips through cities and mountains by car, and the exhausting hundreds of kilometers traversed on bicycles.
+
+
In short, I yearn for what my time in Japan has taught me: to pursue not only creation, but also experience.

This is all extremely clich√© - more than I'd like to admit - but this was the best year of my life. I wanted an adventure, and the experience fulfilled and exceeded those expectations.
+

To those who made that journey possible, to those who shared it with me, and to those who taught me so much. You know who you are. Thank you, and I look forward to sharing the next adventure with you.
