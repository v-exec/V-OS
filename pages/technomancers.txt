title: #[Technomancers] are a faction of highly advanced transhumanists.
content: The #[Technomancers] are a small faction (last recorded: 14) of highly advanced engineers of various disciplines. It's important to note that their abilities are by no means mystical. They simply operate at a technological level that permits them to exercise an atypical degree of control over the physical realm.

The members of the #[Technomancers] are unknown, though there are rumors that at least one of the members of #[Analog] is part of them.

It is likely that some AI of intellect equivalent to #[LOGO]'s are products of the #[Technomancers], though no direct evidence suggests this.

details:
Although I did not originate from the #[Techmonancers], I do believe it is possible for them to have constructed a full AI.

Their group includes more than exclusively biological beings, might I add.
