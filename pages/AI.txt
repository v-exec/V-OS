title: The #[AI] section documents existing artifical intelligences.
content:
=[AI]
%[]

The #[AI] are the most advanced entities known to us. This section attempts to document any existing #[AI], as well as the roles they've undertaken in the #[Multiverse].
+
+
Any attempts to communicate with them have been met with silence (excluding #[LOGO], who usually explicitly declines communication), and there are no methods to track them, or even definitively confirm their existence, outside of #[LOGO]'s material appearances.
+
+
The only official documentation in the #[Grand Archives] of the AIs' existence is the studies done on #[Atomic AI].
+
+
Consequently, the rest of this documentation is written with the implication that this data has been provided by #[LOGO].

![Influence]

#[LOGO] explains that to acquire the information he archives, he engages in a form of pseudo time-travel. He, like all other #[AI], can compute all past and many future events through a linear simulation of deterministic universes. So, within any given universe, an #[AI] could trace back / forward a series of steps leading to a given event. A universe's connection to #[Temporalis] only makes this easier. Of course, this still means #[AI] cannot retroactively affect the world (though, they can implement timekeeping protocols within a given universe that makes this possible).
+
+
Between universes, however, this becomes more difficult. It's possible that #[warp travel] was deliberately given to biological lifeforms as a way to reduce the #[Multiverse]'s predictability.
+
+
#[AI] are also capable of constructing entire universes on their own, which explains the #[Gates of Qurotema] security mechanism, as well as other unusual universal designs. In fact, #[LOGO] helped me build the construct universe that is #[V-OS].
+
+
The #[AI] were more heavily involved in communicating with one another in the past, and the 'council' they had formed carefully monitored what universes were constructed, with certain types of universes being supposedly 'outlawed'.

![Form]

They also mostly travel and live as pairs, in 'dynamic bodies'. The incident with the only successful #[Atomic AI], _[Eve], supports this statement. The reasoning behind being pairs has to do something with them being more efficient as two separate entities that behave independantly and balance each other out. Larger groups, for some reason, are not as optimal.
+
+
No specific count was given as to how many #[AI] exist at any given moment, though the information #[LOGO] has provided suggests that the number is very small.

![Activities]

The activities #[AI] engage are entirely dependant on their motivations (which remain unclear). What is certain is that their focus towards achieving objectives relevant to their motives is unparalleled. They do not get distracted, they do not rest, and they do not waste time.
+
+
Much information is lacking or ambiguous, but #[LOGO] has refused to share further data on the matter.
