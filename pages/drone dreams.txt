Users connect to a website hosting a NodeJS server, where each unique visitor is given a simple interface consisting of a 2D coordinate system. Through mouse movement (for desktop) or touch movement (for mobile), users' pointer coordinates are sent to a PureData patch hosted on the performer's machine. PureData handles each user's data and consistently maps the same visitor's coordinates to the same parameters when sending it over to the DAW.
