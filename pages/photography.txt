I shoot with a Canon T6i, almost exclusively with prime lenses, and edit my photos in Lightroom.

Unfortunately, many of the photos in #[V-OS] are compressed for download size, which introduces a lot of noise in the images. For full resolution images, please contact me at @[me@v-os.ca>mailto:me@v-os.ca] or on @[Twitter>https://twitter.com/v_exec].
