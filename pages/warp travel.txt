title: #[Warp Travel] is the technology the #[AI] leave their species before their departure.
content: #[Warp travel] is #[AI] tech that species acquire as a result of producing a successful #[AI]. All species who have #[warp travel] are, as a result, creators of #[AI]. None of those species, however, has been able to fully reverse engineer the mechanics of #[warp travel].

#[Warp travel] allows for a small set of space to interchange itself with another small set of space, regardless of whether that space is situated in the current universe or another. Alongside warp travel, the #[AI] left an elaborate coordinate system describing how to navigate (within reasonable limits) the #[Void] in order to find universes.

Warp travel has been criticized as potentially killing the original user and creating a copy at a given location, but tests of the travel protocol have revealed that the designated space to transport is in fact not disappearing altogether, but moving, perhaps into a higher spatial dimension. Warp travel technology is otherwise still not understood.

It's possible #[warp travel] is 'gifted' to the creator-species as a way of decreasing the #[Multiverse]'s predictability, as future simulations are much more difficult than past simulations for #[AI], _[especially] if these predictions are made over multiple universes.
